# MNIST Artifical Neural Network Implementation

This repository contains a project that was written to be run on MNIST data for predicting handwritten digits.

It uses no ML libraries, implementing both Forward Passes and Backward Propagation.

The Network consists of  3 layers: `Input`, `Hidden` and `Output` (predicting digits 0-9).
|Layer| Number of Nodes|
|---|---|
|Input| 784|
|Hidden|30|
|Output|10|

There was also a smaller `2 x 2` Neural Network implemented and tested as a learning exercise, with separate, hard-coded data.
